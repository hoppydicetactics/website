### Anti (page 28)

- [ANTI-KEYWORD X+]: An unmodified Wound roll of ‘x+’ against a target with the matching keyword scores a Critical Wound.


### Big Guns Never Tire (page 20)

- MONSTERS and VEHICLES can shoot, and be shot at, even while they are within Engagement Range of enemy units. Each time a ranged attack is made by or against such a unit, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll (unless shooting with a Pistol).


### Blast (page 26)

- Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic for every five models in the target unit (rounding down).
- Can never be used against a target that is within Engagement Range of any units from the attacking model’s army (including its own).


### Devastating Wounds (page 28)

- A Critical Wound inflicts mortal wounds equal to the weapon’s Damage characteristic, instead of any normal damage.


### Hazardous (page 28)

- After a unit shoots or fights, roll one Hazardous test (one D6) for each Hazardous weapon used. For each 1, one model equipped with a Hazardous weapon is destroyed (Characters, Monsters and Vehicles suffer 3 mortal wounds instead).


### Indirect Fire (page 26)

- Can target and make attacks against units that are not visible to the attacking unit.
- If no models are visible in a target unit when it is selected, then when making an attack against that target with an Indirect Fire weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll and the target has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.


### Lethal Hits (page 25)

- Weapons with [LETHAL HITS] in their profile are known as Lethal Hits weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, a Critical Hit automatically wounds the target.


### Lone Operative (page 19)

- Unless part of an Attached unit (see Leader, page 39), this unit can only be selected as the target of a ranged attack if the attacking model is within 12".


### Melta (page 26)

- [MELTA X]: Increase the Damage by ‘x’ when targeting units within half range.


### Stealth (page 20)

- If every model in a unit has this ability, then each time a ranged attack is made against it, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll.


### Sustained Hits (page 28)

- [SUSTAINED HITS X]: Each Critical Hit scores ‘x’ additional hits on the target.
