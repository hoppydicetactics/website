### Terrain

Ruin windows are always considered closed. This does not apply to unclosed windows at the edge of a ruin wall, e.g:

{{< figure src="/images/hoppy-dice-tournament/ruin.webp" alt="Open window example" >}}


### Models and painting

Whenever possible, models should represent the equipment selected in the list (wysiwyg).
If this is not the case, it must be ensured that it is clear to the opponent which units are equipped and how.

Bases must correspond to the current official sizes.

Models do not have to be painted, but the 10 victory points for painting per game may only be written if all models comply with the [Battle Ready standard](https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/xcSERTQx/citadel-colour-just-what-is-battle-ready/).

Conversions are allowed as long as it is clear which model/unit they represent.
They may not result in any technical advantages for themselves.


### Bring along

- Models 
- All required rules
- Chapter Approved 2025-26: Mission Deck¹
- Measuring tape, dice, other game aids

¹: Alternatively, the Random Mission feature of the [Tabletop Battles app](https://ttba.goonhammer.com/) can be used if the cards and missions are known.
